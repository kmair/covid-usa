This project aims to track down the essential stats of COVID-19 within the US and estimating the cases and deaths based on time-series analysis and deep learning

## Overview

The project accomplishes 2 major things:

**Important stats**

In addition to the tally of cases, it is very important to analyze them in proportion with their populations. 
Another highly debated approach to counter the pandemic was in the approach taken by the states based on the governing officials. We can filter data on:

- Governing party 
- Death-case ratio
- Total and Per-capita tally 
- Weekly growth (To monitor recent hotspots)

**Future forecasts**

Based on the state selected on the map, the forecast for 10 days in future is displayed. The models running in the background are:

- ARIMA model
- LSTM model

## Usage

To reproduce this project locally, do the following steps:
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kmair/covid-usa.git
```

2. Setup the environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the `app.py` file
```
python app.py
```
Then, go to: http://127.0.0.1:8050/

## Contributing

To provide additional inputs to the dashboard or make changes, feel free to send a pull request. Some of the aspects one can look at are:
1. Modeling the time series county-wise for more discrete stats and forecasts.
The major issue would be to create county-wise forecasts owing to the high variance in cases across counties making the forecasts extremely unpredictable and even stationarity of the model for each and every county makes it very difficult to analyze and normalize before predicting. 
2. Create a Bayesian probability around the LSTM predictions to know the upper and lower uncertainty limits.
